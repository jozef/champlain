Champlain
=========

Perl bindings for the C library "libchamplain" that provides a ClutterActor for
displaying geographical maps from various free sources. Libchamplain provides a
simple mechanism for rendering maps in an application or for embedding maps in
an existing application.

The library relies on Clutter for all rendering and can easily be embedded in
any Gtk2 application (look for Gtk2::Champlain on CPAN).

The maps displayed are taken from various sources, all providing maps for free,
at the moment the following sources area available: OpenStreetMap, OpenAerialMap
and Maps for free. It's also possible to provide other sources through a simple
API.

For more information about libchamplain refer to the library's web site:
